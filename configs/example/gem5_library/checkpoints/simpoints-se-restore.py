This configuration script shows an example of how to restore a checkpoint that
was taken for SimPoints in the script
configs/example/gem5_library/checkpoints/simpoints-se-checkpoint.py.
The SimPoints, SimPoints' interval length, and the warmup instruction length
are passed into the SimPoint module, so the SimPoint object will store and
calculate the warmup instruction length for each SimPoint based on the
available instructions before reaching the start of the SimPoint. With the
Simulator module, an exit event will be generated to stop when the warmup
session ends and the SimPoints interval ends.

This script builds a more complex board than the board used for taking
checkpoints.
